# Workout-01

Project Objective:

The first workout of Stat 133 will focus on different ways to rank NBA teams, using methods from simple observed variables to derived, composite indices like efficiency (EFF). Throughout the workout, we will assume that only player statistics are available (no win-loss for teams, no championship).

Skills Practice:
- Use the packages dplyr and ggplot2, and work with the tibbles dataframe
- Practice using Github Repository using a more complex file structure
